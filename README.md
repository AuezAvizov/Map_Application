# Campus Map Application

This is a simple campus map application developed using Android Studio. The project uses **OSM (OpenStreetMap)** to display various campus buildings, each with its own marker on the map. When a user clicks on a marker, detailed information about the building is displayed in a separate fragment.

## Features
- Displays campus buildings on an interactive map using OpenStreetMap.
- Markers represent various buildings on the campus.
- Clicking on a marker opens a detailed view of the selected building.
- Fragment-based architecture for better separation of concerns.

## Current Status

## TODO

- Improve UI/UX for a better user experience.
- Add more interactive features, such as search and filtering.
- Complete other enhancements as the development continues.
